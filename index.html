            We are creating history as we prepare to re-launch India’s
            most-loved airline with the promise of bringing back the warmth,
            understated elegance, and efficient operations that Jet Airways was
            synonymous with for more than 25 years.

            <p>Launched in 1993, Jet Airways grew to become synonymous with premium air travel for discerning travellers in India. It eventually flew to over 65 destinations in India and across the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North America, with hubs in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and gateways in Amsterdam, Paris, London, and Abu Dhabi. It flew 124 narrow-body and wide-body aircraft on nearly 1000 domestic and international routes, before it suspended operations in April 2019.</p>
